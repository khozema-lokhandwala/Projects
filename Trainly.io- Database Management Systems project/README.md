For the ease of testing of out project, here are three credentials for each type of user

The tasks and complex queries that a student can perform:
Task C, Task E, Task F, Task H, Complex Query 3

The tasks and complex queries that an admin can perform:
Task B, Task C, Task D, Task G, Task H, Complex Query 1, Complex Query 2

The tasks and complex queries that a faculty can perform:
Complex Query 4, Complex Query 5

All the new users can perform Task A (user registration)


Here are each program files' name and what they do briefly:

Here’s how the files are compared and combined:

In order to login, you will need the index.php, login.php.

For Task A, which is the user registration, it will require user_registration.php, user_process.php.

For Task B it requires taskb.php, taskbad.php, taskbadm.php, taskbb1.php and taskbinter.php

For Task C TaskCactionadmin.php and TaskCadmin.php are required if an admin wants to execute it. But for student only TaskCactionstudent.php is needed.

For Task D it requires TaskD.php, TaskDaction.php and TaskDnext.php

For Task E it requires TaskE.php and TaskEaction.php

For Task F it requires TaskF.php and TaskFaction.php

For Task G it requires TaskG.php, TaskGlast.php and TaskFaction.php

For Task H it requires TaskH.php, TaskHprocessadmin.php and TaskHprocessstudent.php for the both the administrator and the student to run.

For complex query 1 it requires request1.php and request1action.php

For complex query 2 it requires request2.php and request2action.php

For complex query 3 it requires request3.php and request3action.php

For complex query 4 it requires request4.php and request4action.php

For complex query 5 it requires request5.php and request5action.php


Besides, for some tasks, if we login as some random user, the dropdown list for some specific tasks will be null, that is because there is no value related to it. We didn't implement another option for this situation because of time limit.
