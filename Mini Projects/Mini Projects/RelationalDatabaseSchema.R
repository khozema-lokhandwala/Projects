## A Note about the ROWIDs.
# We enabled the WITHOUT ROWID optimization for the Student and the Course tables since
# both of these tables had columns that could be intuitively used as a unique identifier 
# for information in that table. For the Student table the primary key is the studentID, 
# and for the Course table the primary key is the courseID. Since the Enrollment table did
# not have such a column, we used the ROWID as the primary key.
#
# The following two queries demonstrate that the Enrollment table has a ROWID as the
# primary key, wheras the Student and Course tables do not.
